% This chapter gives reader the background knowledge they will need in order to understand the following chapters. This should not include descriptions of the work you have done, but it should provide the motivation for why you did it.  Some reports will have two chapters of background material (e.g. one on general background from books, and one providing a review of journal articles you have read).
\label{ch:introduction}
This chapter introduces the report and tells the reader what they should expect
to see in the next chapters. We should introduce the contents of the
following two chapters in a qualitative way and maybe give some context and
motivation for the research.
