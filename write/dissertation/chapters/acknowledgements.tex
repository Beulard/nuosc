This is section if optional. However, if someone helped you, it is polite to acknowledge the fact. There may be quite a lot of overlap with the Preface section: it is much more important to have a complete Preface than a complete Acknowledgements section. 

You might want to put in a placeholder set of acknowledgments if otherwise the anonymity of your candidate number would be compromised, e.g. ``Thank you to PhD students XX and YY for....''.

You can include personal acknowledgments, e.g. to your Mum. That can come across as a bit naff (except in a PhD thesis), but it is your choice, and you certainly won't loose marks as a result.
