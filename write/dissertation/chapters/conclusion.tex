\section{Summary}
It is clear that the next generation of experiments
is being designed specifically to solve the remaining issues in the theory of
neutrino oscillations. Using a simple model of neutrino oscillations and
preliminary results from the designing groups, we are able to show
quantitatively how sensitive we expect DUNE and Hyper-K to be to two of the
as-yet-unknown oscillation parameters, namely the neutrino mass hierarchy and
the CP-violating phase $\delta_{CP}$.

From figure~\ref{fig:sens_mh}, we predict that DUNE, with an exposure of 150
kt$\cdot$MW$\cdot$year, will reject one of the hierarchies with a significance
greater than $5\sigma$ under any combination of mass hierarchy and
$\delta_{CP}$. DUNE's sensitivity to CP violation (fig.~\ref{fig:sens_cp}) is
fairly low, exceeding a $5\sigma$ significance for only about 10\% of possible
$\delta_{CP}$ values, for either hierarchy.

We predict that Hyper-K, after a 10-year exposure to the J-PARC beam, is
much less sensitive to the mass hierarchy than DUNE, with a maximum
significance around $3\sigma$ (fig.~\ref{fig:hk_sens_mh}). However its CP violation
sensitivity (fig.~\ref{fig:hk_sens_cp}) appears exceedingly high, being better than
$5\sigma$ for 75\% of the possible $\delta_{CP}$ values under either hierarchy.

Evidently, the most beneficial outcome for neutrino physics would result from
combining the two experiments, with DUNE rejecting one of the hierarchies and
Hyper-K confirming or disproving CP violation. In reality, many more neutrino
experiments are currently running or being designed, and the bigger picture is
full of interesting details that are beyond the scope of this report, such as
parameter degeneracies, the existence of sterile neutrinos or non-standard
neutrino interations (see~\cite{raut}).

Thus what we present here is merely a minimal and incomplete picture, but it is
hopefully a worthwhile attempt at providing insight into the future of neutrino
oscillation experiments.


\section{Shortcomings and future work}
There are many ways in which this project is incomplete, some of which stand
out more than others. 
One of them is that our model only considers the appearance events resulting
from the ``neutrino'' mode of the respective accelerator. Both the LBNF and J-PARC
beams are designed to be able to run in ``neutrino'' or ``anti-neutrino'' mode,
i.e.~it is possible to reverse the focusing magnetic field such that
anti-neutrinos are predominantly present in the beam. Both DUNE and Hyper-K are planned
to collect data under both polarities.
In addition to increasing the overall sensitivity (since more data is
collected), this has the effect of breaking the $\theta_{23}$ degeneracy, as
discussed in section~\ref{sec:state}, resulting in an extra dimension in
parameter space and, if modelled properly, a greater and more accurate insight
into the potential outcomes of the experiment.

Secondly, as pointed out in section~\ref{sec:sens_cpv}, we do not explicitely
evaluate the distribution of the CP violation test statistic
$\Delta\chi^2_{CPV}$, which impedes our ability to interpret CP violation
sensitivity results. A more thorough study would include explicit determination
of the distributions of both the mass hierarchy test statistic $\Delta\chi^2$
of equation~\ref{eq:dc2} as well as $\Delta\chi^2_{CPV}$, through Monte Carlo
simulations of the experiment.

Thirdly, our results are given only for a fixed value of the exposure of the detector to
the beam. A straightforward extension to the code would allow us to determine
the sensitivity \emph{as a function of exposure}. From this information, a
value of the ``critical exposure'' could be extracted.  We could define
this value, for example, as the exposure for which the mass hierarchy
rejection significance is greater than $5\sigma$ for all values of
$\delta_{CP}$. Coincidentally, for DUNE, this critical exposure seems to be
quite close to 150 kt$\cdot$MW$\cdot$year (see figure~\ref{fig:sens_mh}).

In section~\ref{sec:hyperk}, we quickly mentioned the construction of a second
Hyper-K detector in Korea. Again, with minor additions to the code, the
increase in sensitivity of the Hyper-K experiment could have been evaluated, 
leading to more relevant results.

Finally, and although it would require significantly more work to make
the code flexible enough, the model could be expanded to atmospheric neutrinos,
in order to more realistically model Hyper-K, and to allow the incorporation of
experiments such as IceCube collaboration's PINGU and ICAL.
