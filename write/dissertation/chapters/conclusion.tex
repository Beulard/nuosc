All reports should include a conclusions chapter. This can be short. This can collate conclusions of previous chapters (these can be direct copies, rather than reworded, but ask your supervisor to check that this is OK in your specific context).

Some conclusions chapters will include a section describing future work. 

Take the opportunity to reflect on your experience. If you were able to go back in time 9 months, what advice would you give yourself?
