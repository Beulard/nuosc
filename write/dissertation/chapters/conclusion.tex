\label{ch:conclusion}
Mention how we didn't take the antineutrino mode into account, which
theoretically increases sensitivity, especially CPV (?).  

We could have evaluated sensitivity as a function of exposure to see evolution
of significance over time.

We could have done this for more future experiments, eg T2HKK and PINGU-icecube.

We could have digged deeper in the statistics and evaluated ourselves through
MC the distribution of $dc2$ for MH and CPV.


All reports should include a conclusions chapter. This can be short. This can collate conclusions of previous chapters (these can be direct copies, rather than reworded, but ask your supervisor to check that this is OK in your specific context).

Some conclusions chapters will include a section describing future work. 

Take the opportunity to reflect on your experience. If you were able to go back in time 9 months, what advice would you give yourself?
