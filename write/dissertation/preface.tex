This dissertation is a report of the work that was done from September 2017 to
April 2018, as part of an MPhys final year project.

Where mathematical derivations are presented that are not a product of our
original work, we make it known explicitly and provide a reference to the
original author(s).


All graphs shown in this report are results of our neutrino oscillation
model, with the exception of figure~\ref{fig:nuflux} which is a reproduction
from the DUNE Conceptual Design Report\cite{cdr}. The ROOT framework\cite{ROOT}
is used to produce the plots.
The model is a C++ implementation of the formalism of chapter~\ref{ch:osc} and
the statistics of section~\ref{sec:statistics}. For
reference, it is available publicly at
\href{url}{https://github.com/beulard/nuosc}.
In order to evaluate experimental sensitivities, the code requires predicted
integrated event rates to be provided as inputs. In the case of DUNE and Hyper-K,
these are estimated from performance estimates of the beamline and detector,
and are presented in their respective design reports\cite{cdr, hyperk}.

Our results are unique but not original, as similar results can be found ---
and are often referenced throughout the text --- in the neutrino oscillation
physics literature.


%You do not get extra marks from including a preface, but you will have marks
%deducted if you do not! The purpose of the “preface” is for you to state
%explicitly the extent to which your dissertation relies on the work of others,
%and highlight the portion that you claim to be your own original work.  Without
%this statement, it will be assumed that none of the work is your own, and that
%your report is simply a review of what other people have done. Please discuss
%with your supervisor to ascertain what, if any, of the work you have done is
%not just new to you, but new to the field, i.e. original research. If there are
%any aspects of your project are original, however small, and even if achieved
%in collaboration with others, make sure this is made very clear in the preface
%and abstract. 
%b.	An example preface is as follows: “Chapter 1 is review material (all
%references are given in Section 7). The data in section 2.1 were provided by my
%supervisor.  The analysis in section 3.2 was carried out using codes that were
%adapted from those developed by PhD Student Santa Claus. I wrote the codes used
%to carry out the analysis in Chapter 4 from scratch. The results presented in
%5.1 are, the best of the knowledge of my supervisor and I, original and are
%currently being prepared for publication in a refereed journal. The derivation
%included in Appendix B was carried out by myself before the final year project
%time period.”
